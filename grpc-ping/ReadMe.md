# gRPC Ping Example

Welcome to the gRPC Ping example in the Go scratchpad repository! This example demonstrates how to create a simple gRPC server and client for sending ping messages between them.

## Running the Example

To run the gRPC Ping example, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codifierr/go-scratchpad.git

2. **Navigate to gRPC Ping Example**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    cd go-scratchpad/grpc-ping

3. **Run the Server**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    go run server/main.go

4. **Run the Client**: Open another terminal window and navigate to the grpc-ping directory again. Run the gRPC client:

    ```bash
    go run client/main.go

5. **Observe the Output**: The server will respond to ping requests from the client with pong responses.

That's it! You've successfully run the gRPC Ping example.
