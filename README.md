# go-scratchpad
Welcome to go-scratchpad â€“ a collection of Go code snippets, demo projects, and reference implementations that you can use as a starting point for building your own applications. This repository is designed to showcase different patterns, libraries, and techniques in Go, which you can explore and adapt to your own projects.

The code here is meant to be used as a reference or inspiration for building your own products, rather than directly reusable out-of-the-box.
